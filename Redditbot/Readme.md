This is a simple script I made for monitoring a select reddit of your choice.
I was looking for pc parts when I was looking to build one for myself and
I did not have time to monitor the buildapcsales reddit so here we have
a script that sends notifications to my discord server when I a certain
part was posted. At the time I was looking for a gpu and ssd

Run the discord.py file to get the notifications through discord.
